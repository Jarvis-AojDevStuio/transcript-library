# Intake Questions — RepoArchitect

Structured questions for the AskUserQuestion tool. Used by the NewProject workflow to collect all inputs before framework selection.

Questions are organized into 4 groups, delivered as 3-4 AskUserQuestion calls (batched for efficiency).

| Input         | Default              |
| ------------- | -------------------- |
| Product type  | Web Application      |
| Repo state    | New project          |
| Primary users | Internal developers  |
| Tech stack    | TypeScript / Node.js |
| Deployment    | Platform-managed     |
| Team size     | Solo / Small         |
| Compliance    | None / Standard      |
| CI strictness | Standard             |
| Repo model    | Single repo          |
| Visibility    | Private              |

## Question Delivery Strategy

Deliver questions in 3 AskUserQuestion calls to minimize user friction:

1. **Call 1:** Questions 1.1 + 1.2 + 1.3 + 1.4 (App & Repo Context)
2. **Call 2:** Questions 2.1 + 2.2 (Tech & Deployment)
3. **Call 3:** Questions 3.1 + 3.2 + 4.1 + 4.2 (Scale + Automation)

AskUserQuestion supports up to 4 questions per call. Group related questions together.
